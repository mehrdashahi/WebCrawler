# WebCrawler

Simple webcrawler application. 

Prompts the user for a URL address (including the http) and a search word and a maximum number of pages to be visited, crawls the pages,, 
and outputs the contents of each page in a seperate text file. 

Seperates the files in two directories by putting the pages in which an instance of the word was found in a different directory 
than the pages in which no instance was found.
